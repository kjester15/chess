# chess
Chess, played in the command line

Rules for player input:
1. Algebraic notation MUST be used, and proper capitalization is necessary.
    - Leading letters for piece specification must be capitalized (ex. 'Kg5')
    - File notation is always lowercase (ex. 'Kg5' or 'e4')
    - When specifying file AND rank for a specific piece, file must come before rank (ex. 'Kd2g5')
2. 

Notes:
- variable naming is an absolute mess. 
- Classes are a mess - if I had time to refactor the whole thing I would
